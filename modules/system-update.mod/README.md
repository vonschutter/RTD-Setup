![RTD Update Screenshot](Media_files/Scr2.png?raw=true "Executing the Script")

The RTD Updater was created to make it simple to update via all channels; including snap repositories from Ubuntu and flat pack repositories that have been configured. This update script has the ability to update itself from this Git hub repository as well as ensure that all channels are enabled.

This script can function independently of the other management scripts by RTD: 
 
This update script supports the following instructions:
``` 
 - Default : Just running this script will update via all configured channels.
 - update :  Parameter update will update the updater to the latest version. 
 - setup :   Parameter setup make sure that you are using all software channels 
 ```
