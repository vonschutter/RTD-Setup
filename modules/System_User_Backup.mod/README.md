**Backup Passphrase Prompt:**
The too will insist that you provide a password to use as an encryption key for your backup. This s a requirement.
you backup must be encrypted because the reason for using this tool is generally to manually bakup a users data to an 
external device before reinstalling the Operating System on the same machine or to move from one computer to the next.

**Backup Choices**
Backup choices are generally choosing the whole home folder of a user (99% of the time), but some choices are provided 
beyond that. It is possible to make a few selective choices beynod the whole home folder that make sense. It may be that the 
personal settings are not compatible with the upgraded system or the new system for some reason and it may just make sense to grab
documents, pictures, videos, personal fonts, and any VM's. Please NOTE that KVM Virtual Machines reside in the system part outside 
of the users own data and the system password will be requested; unless the system password is used as the encryption password (it will then be automatic).

**Backup Destination Selection:**
The backup requires a destination to be selected. This is usually an external disk or a large thumbdrive. This uses a hight level of
compression to make the best use of the storage.

**Backup Completion Notification:**
Once all the backup tasks are completed (none of them are mutually exclusive) an notification of the location and filenamese 
will be displayed. The filenames include the date in the name.
