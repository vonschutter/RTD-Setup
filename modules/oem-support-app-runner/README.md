The OEM Support Tool Runner is part of the RTD Power Tools. 


## Overview

This is a simple tool to run OEM tools. These may be to create boot media and other tasks from a verified tool. The tools are stored in compressed files to use as little space as possible and are checked for consistency prior to being run. 

If the tool is run with no options at all:
