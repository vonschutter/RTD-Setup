## Purpose:
This is a tool to start and monitor a Java minecraft server. If the Ubuntu Minecraft Server Manager finds a minecraft server in the ~/bin/ directory in a users home folder, it will start it, and if it does not find a Minecraft server it will download one for you. BONUS: It will also announce the Minecraft server on the local network. 

## How to use this script. 
To use this script just download this script (minecraft.server) to your home folder and run it. It will automatically: 

1. Install or reuse a handy Ubuntu server or desktop system. 
2. SSH to your Ubuntu system or open a terminal if you are using your Ubuntu Desktop. 
3. To download and optionally install the latest Minecraft (you may cut and paste the line below):

```
wget https://github.com/vonschutter/RTD-Minecraft-Server-Manager/raw/master/minecraft-server -O ~/minecraft-server && chmod +x ~/minecraft-server && ~/minecraft-server
```

4. Then to run the RTD-Minecraft-Server-Manager next time you want to by typing: 

```
~/minecraft.server
```

As of version 1.02 you can also launch the "minecraft.server" with the "--update" option to download the latest minecraft version automatically. 

```
~/minecraft.server --update
```

## Features:
When the RTD-Minecraft-Server-Manager is started, it will do the collowing.

- Check and see if Minecraft is installed in the expected localion on the server.
