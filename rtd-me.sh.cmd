#:: Author(s):	SLS, KLS, NB.  Buffalo Center, IA & Avarua, Cook Islands
#:: Version:	1.07
#::
#::
#:: Purpose: 	The purpose of the script is to decide what scripts to download based
#::          	on the host OS found; works with both Windows, MAC and Linux systems.
#::		The focus of this script is to be compatible enough that it could be run on any
#::		system and compete it's job. In this case it is simply to identify the OS
#::		and get the appropriate script files to run on the system in question;
#::		In its original configuration this bootstrap script was used to install and
#::		configure software appropriate for the system in question. It accomplishes this
#::		by using the idiosyncrasies of the default scripting languages found in
#::		the most popular operating systems around *NIX (MAC, Linux, BSD etc.) and
#::		CMD (Windows NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 8, and 10).
#::
#:: NOTE:	To redirect this script to your own repository, simply rename the first 3 letters
#::		to match the name of your repository ("TLA"-Setup), and set the _GIT_PROFILE variable
#::		to the repo user or org to override the default (git username)...
#::
#:: Background: This system configuration and installation script was originally developed
#:: 		for RuntimeData, a small OEM in Buffalo Center, IA. The purpose of the script
#:: 		was to install and/or configure Ubuntu, Zorin, or Microsoft OS PC's. This OEM and store nolonger
#:: 		exists as its owner has passed away. This script is shared in the hopes that
#:: 		someone will find it usefull.
#::
#::
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#
#	NOTE:	This terminal program is written and documented to a very high degree. The reason for doing this is that
#		these scripts are seldom changed and when they are, it is usefull to be able to understand why and how
#		things were built. Obviously, this becomes a useful learning tool as well; for all people that want to
#		learn how to write admin scripts. It is a good and necessary practice to document extensively and follow
#		patterns when building your own apps and config scripts. Failing to do so will result in a costly mess
#		for any organization after some years and people turnover.
#
#		As a general rule, we prefer using functions extensively because this makes it easier to manage the script
#		and facilitates several users working on the same scripts over time.
#
#
#	RTD admin scrips are placed in /opt/rtd/scripts. Optionally scripts may use the common
#	functions in _rtd_functions and _rtd_recipies.
#	  _rtd_functions -- contain usefull admin functions for scripts, such as "how to install software" on different systems.
#	  _rtd_recipies  -- contain software installation and configuration "recipies".
#	Scripts may also be stand-alone if there is a reason for this.
#
#	Taxonomy of this script: we prioritize the use of functions over monolithic script writing, and proper indentation
#	to make the script more readable. Each function shall also be documented to the point of the obvious.
#	Suggested function structure per google guidelines:
#
#	function_name () {
#		# Documentation and comments...
#		...code...
#	}
#
#	We also like to log all activity, and to echo status output to the screen in a frienly way. To accomplish this,
#	the table below may be used as appropriate:
#
#
#				OUTPUT REDIRECTION TABLE
#
#		  || visible in terminal ||   visible in file   || existing
#	  Syntax  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||   file
#	==========++==========+==========++==========+==========++===========
#	    >     ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    || overwrite
#	    >>    ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    ||  append
#	          ||          |          ||          |          ||
#	   2>     ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    || overwrite
#	   2>>    ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    ||  append
#	          ||          |          ||          |          ||
#	   &>     ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    || overwrite
#	   &>>    ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    ||  append
#	          ||          |          ||          |          ||
#	 | tee    ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    || overwrite
#	 | tee -a ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    ||  append
#	          ||          |          ||          |          ||
#	 n.e. (*) ||   yes    |   yes    ||    no    |   yes    || overwrite
#	 n.e. (*) ||   yes    |   yes    ||    no    |   yes    ||  append
#	          ||          |          ||          |          ||
#	|& tee    ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |   yes    || overwrite
#	|& tee -a ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |   yes    ||  append
#
#	The best solution is to redirect at the "wrapper" layer; a.k.a. the script that loads these functions
#	and executes them. Simply use the "source" statement to pull in the "_rtd_library" and it will do the rest:
#	you can now simply name each function herein that you wish to have installed on a wide range of distributions.
#
#	Our scripts are also structured in to three major sections: "settings", "functions", and "execute".
#	Settings, contain configurable options for the script. Functions, contain all functions. Execute,
#	contains all the actual logic and control of the script.
#
#	Convention: All exported (global) variables are UPPER case, all temp,local or otherwise are lower case.
#		    Also, all exported variables begin with "_" to avoid any conflict with system or shell variables.
