#::
#::	Purpose: To enable configuration of a newly built linux install. This file will be referenced by
#::		 either Debian setup (Debian , ubuntu, etc.), SUSE auto yast, or Anaconda (red Hat, Fedora etc.).
#::		 This script configures the system to auto login, and run the system configuration choices menu.
#::
#::	Usage:	Simply execute this script to accomplish this task. No parameters required.

#
# This script is shared in the hopes that someone will find it useful.
# For convenience and supportability most actions (work) is stored in a common library used bu multiple scripts.
# To use these functions in the library, simply load the library using the "source" bash built in command. All
# functions will then be available for use. This script demonstrates the simplicity of using these functions.
#
# This script is intended to live in the ~/bin/ or /bin/ folder, alternatively in the $PATH.
# By default this script is placed in /opt/rtd/core/
#
# NOTE: this script is run by the power tools system setup and therefore the oem tools are assumed to be present.
#
# 1 - To see options to use the rtd library type: "bash _rtd_library --help"
# 2 - To see useful documentation on each function in this library: "bash _rtd_library --devhelp or --devhelp-gtk"
