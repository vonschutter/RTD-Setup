# This script is shared in the hopes that someone will find it useful.
# For convenience and supportability most actions (work) is stored in a common library used bu multiple scripts.
# To use these functions in the library, simply load the library using the "source" bash built in command. All
# functions will then be available for use. This script demonstrates the simplicity of using these functions.
#
# This script is intended to live in the ~/bin/ or /bin/ folder, alternatively in the $PATH.
# By default this script is placed in /opt/rtd/core/
#
# NOTE: this script is run by the power tools system setup and therefore the oem tools are asumed to be present.
#
# 1 - To see options to use the rtd library type: "bash _rtd_library --help"
# 2 - To see usefull documentation on each function in this library: "bash _rtd_library --devhelp or --devhelp-gtk"
