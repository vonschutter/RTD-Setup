#:: Version 1.01
#::
#::
#::	Purpose: To define how software is added in one place.
#::		 Software may be downloaded and installed manually, or via package manager or snaps.
#::		 Configuration items are also defined here.
#::	Usage: call this file using the "source" statment in bash. Then simply invoke the relevant recipe (funclion)
#::
#::	This script is shared in the hopes that
#::	someone will find it usefull.
#::
#::
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#
#	NOTE:	This terminal program is written and documented to a very high degree. The reason for doing this is that
#		these apps are seldom changed and when they are, it is usefull to be able to understand why and how
#		things were built. Obviously, this becomes a useful learning tool as well; for all people that want to
#		learn how to write admin scripts. It is a good and necessary practice to document extensively and follow
#		patterns when building your own apps and config scripts. Failing to do so will result in a costly mess
#		for any organization after some years and people turnover.
#
#		As a general rule, we prefer using functions extensively because this makes it easier to manage the script
#		and facilitates several users working on the same scripts over time.
#
#
#	RTD admin scrips are placed in /opt/{_TLA}/scripts. Optionally scripts may use the common
#	functions in _rtd_library and _rtd_recipies.
#	  _rtd_library   -- contain usefull admin functions for scripts, such as "how to install software" on different systems.
#	  _rtd_recipies  -- contain software installation and configuration "recipies".
#
#	Use InstallSoftwareFromRepo, check_dependencies,   ,   
#	to install software as a general rule. These functions will make it simple to add software no matter what the underlying
#	distribution package managment is.
#
#	Only make special cases for packages that are not distributed in the distributions own repositories os as snaps or
#	flatpaks; for example if you must download from a vendors web site (like for example Google Chrome). In such a case
#	you may use the software::vendor_download_and_install function. It will automatically install the package at the url provided.
#
#	Scripts may also be stand-alone if there is a reason for this.
#
#	Taxonomy of this script: we prioritize the use of functions over monolithic script writing, and proper indentation
#	to make the script more readable. Each function shall also be documented to the point of the obvious.
#	Suggested function structure per google guidelines:
#
#	category::function_name () {
#		# Documentation and comments...
#		...code...
#	}

# ---------------------------------------------- SOFTWARE SOURCES --------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Chosing an install source:
# +-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
# | Source                                              | Pro                                | Con                             |
# +-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
# | Native distro repository                            | supported, size, launch speed      | Version lagg, no containment    |
# | Snapcraft.io                                        | Containment, snapcrafters, support | slower launch, integration      |
# | Flathub.com                                         | Containment, open, performance     | Less good for Terminal apps     |
# | AppImage                                            | More self contained, just copy file| No control, no security         |
# | Developer PPA (Ubuntu + derivatives only)           | Known source, performance          | Only Ubuntu, no containement    |
# | Company web page download                           | Known source, performance          | Managment, no containment       |
# +-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
#
# When chosing where to get the application from consider you selection strategy: what is important to you, 
# your users and others. What is the priority? Suggestion: 
# 	- Use contained applications where possible to have better overall security. 
#	- Use contained applications where possible to always have the updated version of an app
# 	- Use flathub.com first for GUI applications for performance and control (flatseal)
#	- Use Snapcraft.io for non GUI apps, as these apps are better implemented and no GUI performance issues
#	- Use Stapcraft or falthub depending on if the original developer provides the app in that format
#	- Use the distro version if you need deep desktop integration, and latest version is not important
#	- Avoid the distro version if different distributions name their packages differently between eachother
#	- Prefer any contained version of an app for easier managment and support (no library issues)
# 	- Follow the path of availability: Contained > Native > vendor site > AppImage in that order
#
#
# ------------------ Installing software from the snap repository is prefferred for terminal apps -------------------------
#
# Snap is a software deployment and package management system developed by Canonical for the Linux operating system.
# The packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of Linux distributions
# allowing distribution-agnostic upstream software packaging. Snap application packages of software are self-contained
# and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches,
# like APT or YUM, which require specifically adapted packages for each Linux distribution therefore adding delay between
# application development and its deployment for end-users.
#
# Supported distributions:
# Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Solus, Manjaro Linux, Linux Mint, OpenEmbedded, Raspbian, OpenWrt and openSUSE.
#
# Security:
# Snaps are also contained from a security point of view and only have the access really needed on a system. The user may
# add additional access descressionally through the "connect" command.
#
# ------------------- Installing software from the flathub repository is prefferred for GUI apps --------------------------
#
# Flatpak (formerly xdg-app) is a software utility for software deployment and package management for Linux. It is advertised
# as offering a sandbox environment in which users can run application software in isolation from the rest of the system.
# Applications using Flatpak need permissions to have access to Bluetooth, sound (with PulseAudio), network, files, etc.,
# permissions that are defined by the maintainer of the Flatpak and can be controlled (added or removed) by users on their
# system.
#
# Flathub, a repository (or remote source in the Flatpak terminology) that is located at flathub.org, has become the de facto
# standard for getting applications packaged with Flatpak. Packages are added to it by both the Flathub administrators and
# the developers of the programs themselves (though the admins have stated their preference for developer-submitted apps).
# Although Flathub is the de facto source for applications packaged with Flatpak, Flatpak can work independently of Flathub;
# it is possible to host a remote and access to remotes that are totally independent of Flathub.
#
# -------------------- Installing software from native distribution repositories  ------------------------------------------
#
# A Linux repository is a storage location from which your system retrieves and installs OS updates and applications.
# Each repository is a collection of software hosted on a remote server and intended to be used for installing and updating
# software packages on Linux systems. When you run commands such as “sudo apt update” or “sudo apt upgrade”, you may be pulling
# package information and package updates from a number of repositories.
#
#    ***Issues with native repositories are that distribusions may name packages differently making management difficult***
#
# For more information on package managers see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager

# A new way to manage native packages on Linux PackageKit. PackageKit is a free and open-source suite of software
# applications designed to provide a consistent and high-level front end for a number of different package management systems.
# PackageKit simplifies how to manage software on several different linux distribution and may even be available on BSD flavors.
# The "software::vendor_download_and_install" function uses package kit because it can istall both rpms and debs, 
# locally and from the repositories.
#
# TEMPLATE: For adding a new menu entry for a single package or bundle of software:
#
#
#    system tag          name
#         |                |
# "recipe_Bundle:_""descriptive_name" () {
# 			# function documentaton (shows on the menu)...
# 			# Echo to terminal using built in functions with color:
# 			write_error		: Prints an error message to terminal in RED
# 			write_host 		: Prints a message to the terminal w. a choice of color
# 			write_information 	: Prints a message to the terminal in BLUE
# 			write_status		: Prints a message to the terminal in GREEN
# 			write_warning 		: Prints a message to the terminal in YELLOW
#
# 			# Install software with distribution package manager (Agnostic)
# 			for i in package1 package2 package3 ; do
# 			     InstallSoftwareFromRepo $i
# 			done
#
# 			# Install flatpaks:
# 			  
# 			software::from_flathub.org package-name $1
#

# 			  
# 			software::from_snapcraft.io package-name $1
#
# 			# Check a dependency (install only if not present):
# 			check_dependencies package-name
#
#			NOTE: installing native packages may have caveats since distributions may name
#				packages differently. For example Fedora and Ubuntu name the 7z packages
#				differently.
#
#			NOTE2: the "$1" after the package-name is if you want to trap the --remove option for 
#				Bundle removals. This is optional.
